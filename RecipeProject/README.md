Here is the source code for my project 'RecipeProject'. This is meant to be a practice project to help in my learning of Angular 7. This is the result of a guided project through a udemy course. 


# RecipeProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Angular help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
