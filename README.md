# Welcome to my Angular Practice folder
This folder is meant to hold all of my course work in learning Angular 7 from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller Udemy course here: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/

As I go through course sections and learn about new features of Angular I will save the module coursework here. Then I will modify RecipeProject to take on those new features so it displays more of the tools and features that Angular has to offer. The current working version of the project is here : https://github.com/mackjew/Angular_Practice/tree/master/RecipeProject

The project was built with Angular CLI 7.3.2
