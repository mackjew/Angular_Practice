# Welcome to my Angular Practice folder
This folder is meant to hold all of my course work in learning Angular 7 from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller Udemy course here: [course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/)

As I go through course sections and learn about new features of Angular I will save the module coursework here. Then I will modify RecipeProject to take on those new features so it displays more of the tools and features that Angular has to offer. The src of the project is here : [https://github.com/mackjew/Angular_Practice/tree/master/RecipeProject](https://github.com/mackjew/Angular_Practice/tree/master/RecipeProject)

The project was built with Angular CLI 7.3.2

I have the RecipeProject also hosted here on a GitHub Page. You can look at the app I have made and see the progress I have made here:
